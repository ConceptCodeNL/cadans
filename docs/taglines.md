## Tagline Usage Guidelines

### Logo Integration
- **Short taglines** (3-4 words): Best for logo integration
- **Medium taglines** (5-7 words): Good for marketing materials
- **Long taglines** (8+ words): Use in descriptions, not logos

### Current Logo Tagline
Currently using: **"GRADING PLATFORM"**
- Simple and descriptive
- Can be replaced with any of the top 5 suggestions
- Works well in both English and Dutch

### Multilingual Considerations
- Taglines should translate well to Dutch
- Consider cultural nuances
- May need separate taglines for EN/NL if direct translation doesn't work

## Recommended Implementation

### Primary Tagline
**"Check-in. Grade. Grow."** or **"Your Check-in Cadence"**

### Secondary Taglines (for different contexts)
- Marketing: "Regular Check-ins. Better Grades."
- User-focused: "Check-in with Confidence"
- Value-driven: "Check-ins That Matter"
- Alternative: "Grade with Rhythm" (if check-in focus not needed)

### Logo Options
1. **With tagline**: Full logo with tagline below "CADANS"
2. **Without tagline**: Just "CADANS" text (cleaner, more minimal)
3. **Contextual**: Use different taglines in different sections

## Testing Recommendations

1. **A/B Testing**: Test different taglines with target users
2. **Feedback**: Gather feedback from teachers, administrators
